A fuzzy evidential reasoning based approach for submarine power cable routing selection for offshore wind farms	OCEAN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Offshore wind farm; Submarine power cable routing; Decision-making; Navigational environment; Fuzzy evidential reasoning; Maritime safety	ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; DECISION-MAKING; SITE SELECTION; MODEL; INSTALLATION; ENVIRONMENT; ENERGY; TOPSIS; SHIPS; AHP	Offshore wind farms have developed fast as an environmentally friendly source of energy. The submarine power cable of the offshore wind farm, used for connecting power generation devices to onshore equipment, may have a significant impact on navigation safety and is prone to being damaged (e.g. caused by fishing or emergency anchoring by ships) when adopting unfavorable routing. This paper proposes a fuzzy evidential reasoning method for submarine power cable routing selection of the offshore wind farm by comprehensively considering the conditions for cable laying and its influence on maritime safety. The kernel of this approach is to establish a three-layer decision-making framework after fuzzification of the input variables, to derive the belief rule base, and to obtain the optimal routing from the submarine power cable candidates using evidential reasoning and index value. The proposed approach is applied to a real routing selection problem of a submarine power cable for an offshore wind farm in Zhejiang Province of China. The resulting choice corresponds to the discussions in a workshop unanimously.

With the increasing capacity and offshore distance, the impact of power losses in the cables on the economic performance of the wind farm becomes significant. Therefore, both the investment on the cables and the cost from the associated energy loss need to be considered in the optimization model. In this work, a detailed power loss cost model accounting for the wake effect's impact on the wind turbine output is proposed. The cable cost and the associated power losses cost are considered in the objective function. The offshore substation location, cable connection layout, and cable sectional area are optimized simultaneously while ensuring an uncrossed cable connection layout via a line segment intersection detection algorithm. Due to the non-convexity of the optimization model, an adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted. The proposed method was validated through a case of a real offshore wind farm, where the simulation results show that the cable connection layout formulation and sectional area selection varies significantly when different power loss model is applied. A 3.14% total cost reduction can be achieved by using the proposed method compared with the case without the power loss model.

Employing stochastic approaches, this tool can quickly find a near-optimum cable connectivity solution based on one of the criteria including capital expenditure (CAPEX), operational expenditure (OPEX), or their combination considering the net present value over the project lifespan. The seabed geo-tech constraints are considered to minimise cable routes across seabed areas where challenging installation conditions may exist, and to avoid cable routes across the seabed areas where the installation is impossible. The tool employs advanced identification of suitable locations of multiple offshore substations for large wind farms. This optimisation tool is coded in Python 2.7 and scripted IPSA + is used as the load flow calculation engine for power loss calculation. This tool has been applied to 4 GW offshore wind projects developed in European and Asian waters and it is demonstrated that the tool automates the design for the inter-array cable system layout and delivers measurable overall project efficiency gains. Comparisons were made between radial design and branched design; it is shown that the branched design can achieve better cost savings than the radial design.

Being an increasingly competitive market, it is very important to minimize establishment costs and increase production profits already at the design phase of new wind parks. This paper is based on many years of collaboration with Vattenfall, a leading wind energy developer and wind power operator, and aims at giving an overview of the experience of using Mathematical Optimization in the field. The paper illustrates some of the practical needs defined by energy companies, showing how optimization can help the designers to increase production and reduce costs in the design of offshore parks. In particular, the study gives an overview of the individual phases of designing an offshore wind farm, and some of the optimization problems involved. Finally it goes in depth with three of the most important optimization tasks: turbine location, electrical cable routing and foundation optimization.

The study shows that, although waves and winds are generally strongly correlated, in some conditions their correlation is lower and the combined energy harvesting more interesting. As spatial conflicts of sea use and demand for maritime space are increasing, the development of the marine renewable energy sector needs to be evaluated in the perspective of the cumulative pressures deriving from present activities or expected from future developments. The evaluation of areas of potential conflicts among human activities, environmental vulnerabilities and marine renewable developments may facilitate the early development of mitigation actions and negotiations between stakeholders. In this study the opportunity of co-locating offshore wind turbines and wave energy converters is analyzed through a spatial planning approach. Both the potential for combining different renewable technologies, and the impact associated to such development was considered in the context of the existing pressures (e.g., naval traffic; mariculture activities; submarine cables routes; dredge spoils dumping; offshore activities; windfarms and ocean energy projects) and vulnerabilities (Marine Protected Areas, Key habitat presence) through quantitative indicators. The portion of Tyrrhenian coast south of Elba island, the northern-western Sardinian coast, and the southern Adriatic and Ionian coastal waters appear to be the most suitable sites. Moreover, the study presents a spatial quantitative methodology to identify sites of potential interest for the development of the marine renewable energy sector in the perspective of cost-effectiveness and environmental impact minimization.

J	Tifroute, M; Bouzahir, H				Tifroute, Mohamed; Bouzahir, Hassane			Optimization for Onshore Wind Farm Cable: Connection Layout using ACO-AIA algorithm	MATEMATIKA			English	Article						Steiner problem; ant colony algorithm; artificial immune algorithm		The wind farm layout optimization problem is similar to the Steiner Minimal Tree Problem (SMTP) of a weighted undirected graph. Due to the cable current-carrying capacity limitation, the cable sectional area should be carefully selected to meet the system operational requirement and this constraint should be considered during the SMTP formulation process. Hence, the traditional SMTP algorithm cannot ensure a minimal cable investment layout. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm based on modified Ants Colony Optimization (ACO) and Artificial Immune Algorithm (AIA) for solving SMTP is introduced. Since the Steiner Tree Problem is NP-hard, we design an algorithm to construct high quality Steiner trees in a short time which is suitable for real time multicast routing in networks. After the breadth-first traversal of the minimal graph obtained by ACO, the terminal points are divided into different convex hull sets, and the full Steiner tree is structured from the convex hull sets partition. The Steiner points can be vaccinated by AIA to get an optimal graph. The average optimization effect of AIA is shorter than the minimal graph obtained using ACO, and the performance of the algorithm is shown. We give an example of application in optimization for onshore wind farm cable. The possibility of using different sectional area's cables is considered in this paper.

AN ANALYSIS OF THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF OFF-SHORE WIND ENERGY IN THE PHILIPPINES	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY, 2019			English	Proceedings Paper	13th ASME International Conference on Energy sustainability	JUL 14-17, 2019	Bellevue, WA	ASME, Adv Energy Syst Div, ASME, Solar Energy Div				The technical feasibility of off-shore wind energy in the Philippines is assessed. Geographic information system is utilized to integrate the different technical data into a single model. Off-shore wind speed data for five years at elevations 10m, 20m, 80m, and 100m from a local database was used as reference for the wind resource study. Two wind turbines were considered for the energy conversion component, Siemens SWT-3.6-120 and Senvion 6.2 M126. The wind speed data was interpolated to 90m and 95m using standard power law to match the hub heights of the turbines studied. The wind power density, wind power, and annual energy production were calculated from the interpolated wind speeds. Areas in the Philippines with capacity factor greater than 30% and performance greater than 10% were considered technically viable. Exclusion criteria were applied to narrow down the potential siting for offshore wind farms, namely, active submerged cables, local ferry routes, marine protected areas, reefs, oil and gas extraction areas, bathymetry, distance to grid, typhoons, and earthquakes. Several sites were determined to be viable with north of Cagayan having the highest capacity factor. The highest wind capacity factor for the offshore wind farms are located in north of llocos Norte (SWT-3.6-120: 54.48% - 62.60%; 6.2M126: 54.04% - 64.79%), north of Occidental Mindoro (SWT-3.6-120: 46.81% - 60.92%; 6.2M126: 45.30% - 62.60%) and southeast of Oriental Mindoro (SWT-3.6-120: 45.60% - 59.52%; 6.2M126: 45.30% - 62.60%). However, these sites are not acceptable due to technical, social, and political constraints. The constraints considered in the study are active submerged cables with a buffer of 5 km, local ferry routes with a buffer of 3km, marine protected areas with a buffer 3 km, reefs with a buffer of 3 km, oil and gas extraction areas with a buffer of 5 km, bathymetry less than 50m, distance to grid of within 120 km, historical typhoon tracks with greater than 250 kph and 50 km buffer, and historical earthquakes with greater than 6.5 magnitude with a buffer of 15 km. Upon application of these exclusion criteria, the potential sites for offshore wind farms are north of Cagayan, west of Rizal, north of Camarines Sur, north of Samar, southwest of Masbate, Dinagat Island, Guimaras, and northeast of Palawan.

All turbines must be connected to power substations by cables. Up to a given number, turbines may be connected along a joint cable in a series circuit, and cable branching at turbine locations is possible. No two cables are allowed to cross each other. As an improvement over previously available models, the model under study enables optimal adaptation of the cable routes to obstacles. Obstacles of two different kinds are considered. First, a set of regions in which cables cannot be laid is accepted as part of the input to the model. Second, the trajectory of one cable plays the role of an obstacle to all other cables. Both obstacle types are modeled by introducing optional connection points, which, contrary to the turbines, do not have to be visited by any cable. By introducing such optional connection points at selected positions, we arrive at a model with some resemblance with the Steiner tree problem. We demonstrate that, by virtue of the optional points, the suggested model is able to identify feasible solutions to problem instances where other models fail to do so. In other instances, the model yields more cost-effective cable layouts than previously studied models do.

J	Fischetti, M; Pisinger, D				Fischetti, Martina; Pisinger, David			Optimizing wind farm cable routing considering power losses	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	28th European Conference on Operational Research	JUL 03-06, 2016	Poznan, POLAND	European Assoc Operat Res Soc		Metaheuristics; Mixed-Integer Linear Programming; Matheuristics; Wind farm optimization; Benchmark instances	OPTIMIZATION; DESIGN; LAYOUT	Wind energy is the fastest growing source of renewable energy, but as wind farms are getting larger and more remotely located, installation and infrastructure costs are rising. It is estimated that the expenses for electrical infrastructures account for 15-30% of the overall initial costs, hence it is important to optimize their design. This paper focuses on offshore inter-array cable routing optimization. The routing should connect all turbines to one (or more) offshore substation(s) while respecting cable capacities, no-cross restrictions, connection-limits at the substation, and obstacles at the site. The objective is to minimize both the capital that must be spent immediately in cable and installation costs, and the future reduced revenues due to power losses. We present a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming approach to optimize the routing using both exact and math-heuristic methods. In the power losses computation, wind scenarios are handled efficiently as part of the preprocessing, resulting in a model of only slightly larger size. A library of real-life instances is introduced and made publicly available for benchmarking. Computational results on this testbed show the viability of our methods, proving that savings in the order of millions of Euro can be achieved. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this article, we address the optimization of cable connections between turbines in an offshore wind park. Different versions of the problem have been studied in the recent literature. As turbines are becoming still more customized, it is important to be able to evaluate the impact of new technologies with a flexible optimization tool for scenario evaluation. In a previous joint project with Vattenfall BA Wind (a global leader in energy production) we have studied and modeled the main constraints arising in practical cases. Building on that model, in the present article, we address new technological features that have been recently proposed by Vattenfall's experts. We show how some new features can be modeled and solved using a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming paradigm. We report and discuss computational results on the performance of our new models on a set of real-world instances provided by Vattenfall.

Optimal Wind Farm Cabling	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY			English	Article						String structure; ring structure; multi-loop structure; 3D seabed; particle swarm optimization	VEHICLE-ROUTING PROBLEM; GENETIC ALGORITHM; NETWORK DESIGN; CUT ALGORITHM; ENERGY	Wind farm cable length has a direct impact on the project cost, reliability, and electrical losses. The optimum cable layout results in a lower unit cost of generating electricity offshore. This paper explores three cabling structures: the string structure, ring structure, and multiloop structure on a three-dimensional seabed The newly proposed multiloop structure increases reliability and proves to be most economic when the failure rate and mean time to repair of cables are relatively high. Particle swarm optimization is used to find the optimal substation location that minimizes the overall cable distance.

Analytical Thermal Rating Method for Cables Installed in J-Tubes	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY			English	Article						Modelling; offshore installations; power cable insulation; power transmission; wind energy integration; wind farms	AMPACITY CALCULATIONS; IEC STANDARD; TROUGHS	One possible thermal pinch point along the route of a wind farm export circuit is a J tube, commonly used to provide mechanical protection to cable sections between the sea floor and the offshore platform. Current ratings for such cable sections are not covered by the scope of IEC 60287, while the existing publications covering such systems have limitations. This paper presents an updated 2-D analytical method and a 3-D extension for the rating of J tubes with short air section lengths. Continuous rating comparisons have been made against a 3-D finite-element model which shows a 4.5% variation in rating from the 2-D analytical model for air section lengths greater than 10 m, rising to 13% for short air section lengths. With the addition of longitudinal heat transfer within the new 3-D analytical approach, this variation decreases by 2.5%. Both methods proposed can be solved readily using conventional spreadsheet tools and are broadly compliant with the IEC 60287 methodology.	[Chippendale, R. D.; Pilgrim, J. A.; Goddard, K.

Being a new and still more competitive field, it is of major interest to investigate new techniques to solve the design challenges involved. In this paper, we consider optimization of the inter-array cable routing for offshore wind farms, taking power losses into account. Since energy losses in a cable depend on the load (i.e. wind), cable losses are estimated by considering a possibly large number wind scenarios. In order to deal with different wind scenarios efficiently we used a precomputing strategy. The resulting optimization problem considers two objectives: minimizing immediate costs (CAPEX) and minimizing costs due to power losses. This makes it possible to perform various what-if analyses to evaluate the impact of different preferences to CAPEX versus reduction of power losses. Thanks to the close collaboration with a leading energy company, we have been able to report results on a set of real-world instances, based on six existing wind parks, studying the economical impact of considering power losses in the cable routing design phase.

J	Fachina, V				Fachina, Vicente			Sustainable freshwater from the tropical oceans	JOURNAL OF THE BRAZILIAN SOCIETY OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Ocean thermal; Offshore wind; Seawater desalination; Sustainable energy; Sustainable freshwater		The northeast region of Brazil has gone through severe droughts for many decades, which tend to get worse due to the climate change scenarios in the twenty-first century. The population has been migrating southbound, which has brought about serious social imbalances. For the tropical surface ocean waters being the largest thermal solar collectors and reservoirs in the planet, a solution is proposed for inexhaustible supply of freshwater by combining two renewable energy routes through a hybrid offshore energy farm, ocean thermal energy conversion, and offshore wind power. Preliminary feasibility studies are carried out for such an energy farm to deliver freshwater, and to be deployed along the coastline of the northeast region of Brazil. It is calculated 0.43 USD/m(3) as a minimum levelized cost of freshwater, for which the total investments, excluded the desalination units, the freshwater pipelines and the electrical cables, amount to USD 28 billion. Other less capital intensive scenarios are shown, with USD 16 billion investment for 0.57 USD/m(3) levelized cost of freshwater.

This hybrid concept is based on clustering wind turbines and connecting each group to an AC/DC power converter installed on a collector platform which is located between the AC wind turbine array and the HVDC offshore platform. Thereby, individual power converters of each wind turbine are not required, since such AC/DC converters can provide variable speed generator control for each cluster. The optimal design for an OWPP based on the hybrid AC-DC topology is formulated as a MINLP problem. The capital costs of each component within the OWPP as well as the costs associated to the inherent losses of this topology are minimized. The optimal number of AC/DC converters and offshore collector platforms needed, as well as their locations, are determined. The cable route connecting the wind turbines between each other is also optimized. The results suggests a good potential for the hybrid AC-DC OWPP topology achieving a total cost saving of 3.76% for the case study compared to the conventional OWPP topology.

Therefore, they currently need governmental support to become competitive and economically attractive for investors. There is a general consensus that a feed-in premium scheme would be most adequate to support offshore wind generation in the North Sea. With increasing distance from shore, scarcity of adequate cable routes, and an increasing need to reduce cost, cross-border projects between two or more North Sea states come into discussion. After discussing different support schemes, we argue that existing nationally oriented instruments have to be amended to become applicable to cross-border projects envisioned in the North Sea. In order to support our arguments quantitatively, we introduce a novel optimization framework that is able to account for the impact of implementing different types of feed-in premium based wind supporting schemes (generation-based and capacity-based) on the development of the offshore grid in the North Sea region. For a given level of support for wind development, an optimal plan includes the grid and offshore wind capacities. The transmission capacities are set in such a way that the congestion revenue collected throughout the life time of the project pays off the investment cost of building the grid. At the same time, the remuneration of the offshore wind farms pays off the unsubsidized initial investment cost of building the wind farms, provided that the premium level is selected adequately. Numerical simulation results are interpreted in economic terms and appraise the quality and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The paper will end with an outlook of how such a joint support scheme might be implemented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Finding the minimum cost array cable layout thus amounts to a vehicle routing problem with the additional constraints that the routes must be embedded in the plane. For this problem, both exact and heuristic methods are of interest. We optimize cable layouts for real-world OWFs by a hop-indexed integer programming formulation, and develop a heuristic for computing layouts based on the Clarke and Wright savings heuristic for vehicle routing. Our heuristic computes layouts on average only 2% more expensive than the optimal layout. Finally, we present two problem extensions arising from real-world OWF cable layouts, and adapt the integer programming formulation to one of them. The thus obtained optimal layouts are up to 13% cheaper than the actually installed layouts.

Model features include upper bounds on the number of cable branches made at any wind turbine, upper bounds on the cable loads, and exclusion of crossing cable segments. The resulting model resembles the capacitated minimum spanning tree problem, with the addition of degree and planarity constraints. Numerical experiments with realistic wind farm data indicate that the benefit from branching is small when using only one cable type, but is up to 13% if allowing for two different cable types.

The two problems are considered with a two steps strategy, solving the layout problem first and then the cable problem. We give an introduction to both problems and present the MILP models we developed to solve them. To deal with interference in the onshore cases, we propose an adaptation of the standard Jensen's model, suitable for 3D cases. A simple Stochastic Programming variant of our model allows us to consider different wind scenarios in the optimization. For the inter-array cable routing, we propose a new MILP model able to deal with different constraints arsing in practical application, such as capacity limitations, substation limitations and non-crossing constraints. Computational results on real-world instances prove the practical viability of the approach.

Impact hypothesis for offshore wind farms: Explanatory models for species distribution at extremely exposed rocky areas	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH			English	Article						Offshore wind farm; Asterias rubens; Echinus esculentus; Laminaria hyperborea; Rocky reef; Underwater video transects multibeam; bathymeby	MULTIBEAM BATHYMETRY; PHYSICAL DISTURBANCE; RENEWABLE ENERGY; SEA-URCHINS; MARINE; KELP; COLONIZATION; ASSEMBLAGES; VESTFJORDEN; COMMUNITY	The increasing need for renewable and clean energy production is likely to result in a diversification of locations for the implementation of offshore wind farms which have been so far predominantly sited on soft substrata. In contrast, offshore wind turbines placed on rocky reefs in highly exposed areas are much less common and the impacts on local flora and fauna can only be hypothesized. On the Western coast of Norway, a rocky reef with a highly complex topography has been chosen to be the first full-scale offshore wind farm in the country. Underwater video analyses and multibeam bathymetry data with a generalized linear model were used opportunistically to investigate the influence of geomorphic explanatory variables on the occurrence of selected taxa (algae, sea urchins and sea stars) identified in the study area. Combining video observations and multibeam bathymetry in a generalized linear model revealed that the geomorphic descriptors: aspect, slope, rugosity, and benthic position indexes (BPI), were of significance for algae, sea urchins and sea stars at Havsul and served in showing their habitat preferences. Kelp occurred in areas of high rugosity, on gentle slopes, at elevated areas with a southerly orientation and on the sheltered side of rock or bedrock. Thus, construction disturbance that modify those variables may lead to a change in the area preferred by kelp. Turbines that shade southerly aspects may affect small kelp plants in reducing their available habitat. Sea urchins were more abundant on steep slopes and both sea stars and sea urchins showed a preference for a complex local relief (high rugosity) and heterogeneity in fine and broad elevation (shown by BPI). Thus, foundations and cable route preparation may significantly change the slope, rugosity of BPI broad, which will change the basis for sea urchin populations. It may likewise significantly change the rugosity or BPI (fine or broad), which may change the distribution of sea stars. The combination of video data and models using multibeam bathymetry yields useful information about the potential impacts of the construction of an offshore wind farm on rocky substratum and allows us to generate impact hypotheses that go beyond what could be hypothesized through a mere general knowledge of the area.

The wind farm network structure means the combined electric power sources (wind turbine) and branching lines. Also, in a wind farm the branching lines are represented by cable underground power lines (cable). The approach presented in this paper was applied to optimize the electrical inter-array cable systems for wind farms which is compatible with both radial and branched design philosophies, and can optimize for total cable length or cable cost. The newness of the proposed approach is based on a combination of classical and met-heuristic algorithms that use graph theory for wind farm cable route optimization. The results of case study clearly demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed method and showed that it can be used as a reliable tool in off-shore wind farm design for optimal cable route determination.

A sustainability index for offshore wind farms and open water aquaculture	COASTAL PROCESSES II	WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Physical Coastal Processes, Management and Engineering	APR 27-29, 2011	Naples, ITALY	Univ Las Palmas, Wessex Inst Technol, Univ Parthenope, WIT, Transact Ecol & Environm, ASCE UK Grp		sustainability index; offshore wind farms; open water aquaculture		One of the possible multi uses of marine space is offshore wind farms and open water aquaculture plans. Unlike coastal installations, offshore wind farms allow for increased availability of wind power and wind persistence, as well as lower visual impact of the turbines. Existing offshore wind farms offer important advantages for aquaculture plans especially in terms of lack of major physical constrains, e.g., navigation routes, submarine cables, marine protected areas. Moreover, enhanced current velocity due to the presence of the piles and to the air fluxes of the turbines may increase the environmental suitability of aquaculture plans in these areas. In addition, the transmission of localized depleted water masses or waste material towards near-shore zones can be avoided, excluding potential impact close to the coast. On the other hand, other environmental constrains (e.g. temperature and salinity variability, dissolved oxygen concentrations, phytoplankton dynamics) need also to be considered when planning aquaculture activities. In this context, the present paper gives a contribution towards the definition of a sustainability index for the large scale localization of marine areas as offshore wind farms and aquaculture plans. This index is developed on the basis of a Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) technique, already used in open water aquaculture localization: raw data were converted to suitability scores, which were combined using additive models, in order to define the overall suitability. A detailed analysis of the environmental suitability is performed for few specific test cases at offshore wind farms located in the Denmark coastal zone, for which some projects of offshore aquaculture plans have been proposed. The use of this sustainability index will perform quantitative evaluations of the degree of compatibility between the offshore wind farms and the open water aquaculture, highlighting the main problems which can rise by the integration of both technologies.

These sand ridges is also known for building power load centers, good industry base of high tech, development of capital market and so on, which are naturally endowed of developing large scale offshore wind farms. These sea radial sand ridges open for a tremendous development space. For example, we can develop 10-15% of the wind resources for an everlasting green resource base with an annual output of 25 million tons provided by standard coal, which allows reducing CO2 emission of 123 million tons per year. Building China Wind Power "Offshore Three Gorges" does not occupy one unit of field, prevent from engendering immigration and cause ecological issues. This paper brings forward new path of combination of large scale of non-grid-connected wind power and high power consumption load, to deal with the difficulty of intermission and fluctuant huge power that cannot be borne by power grid. The authors recommend a series of methods in the articles. That is 1) build several "none carbon type" high power consumption and green heavy chemical industry; 2) utilize wind resources to substitute fossil resources; and 3) realize the span from "high carbon resource to non-carbon resource; 4) build a series of industry bases that use on-grid-connected wind power directly to carry through large scale of sea water desalting and scale of making hydrogen; 5) 100% using offshore wind power to carry through large scale of sea water desalting and hydrogen production to change transmitting electricity to disembark into transmitting fresh water and gas to disembark.

J	Prest, R; Daniell, T; Stendorf, B				Prest, Robert; Daniell, Trevor; Stendorf, Bertram			Using GIS to evaluate the impact of exclusion zones on the connection cost of wave energy to the electricity grid	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						environmental policy; spatial analysis; cable route	RENEWABLE ENERGY; PIPELINE ROUTE; SYSTEM	An increase in the planning and environmental restrictions associated with wind energy has led to a growth in interest towards wave energy. However, as the connection cost of a wave energy development is a driving factor in the development's feasibility, existing wind farm cable-routing techniques used by renewable energy developers may not be satisfactory. A Geographical Information System (GIS) method is presented which optimises the cable route between a wave farm and the electricity network, while taking a range of exclusion zones, such as native vegetation, into account. The optimisation is presented for a South Australian study area, which subsequently showed that exclusion zones reduce the number of suitable locations for wave energy by almost 40%. The method presented also assesses the effect that each exclusion zone applied has upon the number of suitable locations within the study area. The analysis undertaken showed that National Parks and cliffs pose a significant limitation to the potential of a wave energy industry within South Australia. Allowing the transmission route to travel through a National Park, or traverse a cliff, resulted in an increase in the number of locations from which a connection could be made to the electricity grid for less than $10 million of 33% and 50%, respectively. Conservation Parks, Wilderness Areas and native vegetation also have an effect upon the number of suitable locations for wave energy within South Australia. The GIS methods developed may be of assistance to governments in setting appropriate marine renewable energy policy, and also in identifying existing policy which may require amending if the government wishes to pursue and support the development of wave energy.

B	Mair, K		Hinson, P		Mair, K			The installation of submarine cables for offshore wind farms	WIND ENERGY 1999: WIND POWER COMES OF AGE			English	Proceedings Paper	21st British-Wind-Energy-Association Wind Energy Conference	SEP 01-03, 1999	HOMERTON COLL, CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND	Eastern Generat, Border Wind Ltd, RES, B9 Energy, Natl Wind Power, PowerGen Renewables Ltd, Enron Wind Overseas Dev Ltd, British Wind Energy Assoc	HOMERTON COLL			This paper addresses the practicalities of submarine cable installation for offshore wind farms, drawing on project experience from other cable markets and industries. The importance of planning is highlighted throughout, from initial route evaluation, through investigative surveys, final route selection and burial specification, to the cable installation itself and the maintenance and repair regime. This helps identify the potential problems that each project phase will encounter - and must overcome. An integrated, risk-based approach is essential to ensure that all relevant seabed, metocean, environmental, regulatory, engineering and operational conditions and constraints have been taken into account. The various stages of a cable installation operation are discussed, reviewing a range of equipment and techniques needed to achieve the successful installation and burial of the submarine cable system. Some commercial issues are also discussed briefly.
